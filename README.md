IDP project: microservice for interaction with database

To use the io service, simply run docker-compose up --build inside this folder.
Running the server locally will not work, always run through docker.

To use MongoDB Compass and inspect the database, simply create a new connection
with mongodb://idp2025:idp2025@localhost:27018/idp2025?authSource=admin.
